# Naming Conventions in Python:
  * Python follows a set of guidelines established in PEP8, the official style guide. While these conventions are not enforced by the Python interpreter, adhering to them is considered good coding practice.
  * Here are the fundamental rules for naming variables, functions, classes, and other identifiers:
    * Names are case-sensitive.
    * Names cannot start with a digit.
    * Names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
  * Letâ€™s explore different naming styles:
    * Snake Case: All words are in lowercase, separated by underscores. Used for function and variable names.
      * Example: user_name, my_function
    * Pascal Case: Similar to camel case but starts with a capital letter. Used for class names.
      * Example: ClassName, MyClass
    * Camel Case: First letter of each word capitalized except for the first word. Not commonly used in Python.
      * Example: myVariable, isInstance
    * Upper Case with Underscores: Used for constants.
      * Example: PI, MAX_OVERFLOW
