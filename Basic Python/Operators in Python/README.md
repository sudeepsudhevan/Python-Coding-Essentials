# 1. Python Operators:
  * Python provides various operators for performing different operations on variables and values.
  * Here are some common operators:
    * Arithmetic Operators: Used for basic mathematical operations.
      * + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), // (floor division), % (modulo), ** (exponentiation).
    * Comparison Operators: Used to compare values.
      * == (equal), != (not equal), < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to).
    * Logical Operators: Used to combine conditional statements.
      * and, or, not.
    * Assignment Operators: Used to assign values to variables.
      * =, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=.
        
# 2. PEMDAS Rule (Order of Operations):
  * The PEMDAS rule helps determine the order in which mathematical operations are evaluated.
  * Letâ€™s break it down:
    * P: Perform operations inside parentheses or groups first.
    * E: Evaluate any exponents.
    * MD: Perform multiplication and division from left to right.
    * AS: Finally, perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
