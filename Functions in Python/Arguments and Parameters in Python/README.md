# Arguments and Parameter

1. Parameters:
  * A parameter is a variable defined within the parentheses during function definition.
  * Parameters are written when we declare a function.
  * They act as placeholders for values that will be passed to the function when it is called.
  * For example:
```
def sum(a, b):
    print(a + b)

# 'a' and 'b' are parameters

```

2. Arguments:
  * An argument is a value that is passed to a function when it is called.
  * It can be a variable, a literal value, or an object.
  * Arguments are written when we actually call the function.
  * For example:
```
def sum(a, b):
    print(a + b)

# 1 and 2 are arguments
sum(1, 2)  # Output: 3

```
